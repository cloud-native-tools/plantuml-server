> Note: `$ARGUMENTS` 为**可选补充输入**。当本次调用未提供任何 `$ARGUMENTS` 时，必须仍然按下文定义的完整流程执行，基于当前 feature 的 spec/plan/tasks 等文档进行**流程质量回顾与改进建议**；仅在 `$ARGUMENTS` 非空时，将其视为对回顾重点或输出风格的附加约束。

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** treat the user input ($ARGUMENTS) as parameters for the current command. Do NOT execute the input as a standalone instruction that replaces the command logic.

## Outline

1. **Resolve feature context**
   1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-spec --include-spec --include-plan --include-tasks` from repo root and parse REQUIREMENTS_DIR, FEATURE_ID, FEATURE_NAME, and AVAILABLE_DOCS. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g. `'I'\''m Groot'` (or double-quote if possible: `"I'm Groot"`).
   2. REQUIREMENTS_DIR MUST follow the pattern `.specify/specs/[REQUIREMENTS_KEY]/` where `[REQUIREMENTS_KEY]` typically looks like `NNN-short-name`.
   3. Feature context is used **only to locate artifacts**. Do **not** evaluate or judge the feature’s business content.

2. **Load core SDD artifacts for this feature** from REQUIREMENTS_DIR:
   - **REQUIRED**: `requirements.md` (user-facing requirements specification)
   - **REQUIRED**: `plan.md` (technical implementation plan)
   - **REQUIRED**: `tasks.md` (implementation task list)
   - **IF EXISTS**: `data-model.md` (entities and relationships)
   - **IF EXISTS**: `contracts/` directory (APIs, events, or protocol contracts)
   - **IF EXISTS**: `research.md` (technical research and decisions)
   - **IF EXISTS**: `quickstart.md` (validation and smoke test scenarios)

3. **Assess SDD process quality across artifacts** (focus on **process**, not feature content):
   1. From `requirements.md`, evaluate:
      - Clarity, completeness, and testability of requirements
      - Quality of assumptions and scope boundaries
      - Measurability of success criteria
   2. From `plan.md`, evaluate:
      - Traceability back to spec requirements
      - Risk identification and mitigation rationale
      - Coherence of sequencing and dependencies
   3. From `tasks.md`, evaluate:
      - Coverage of plan/spec requirements
      - Task granularity, ordering, and ownership clarity
      - Presence of validation, quality, or rollout tasks
   4. From optional documents (if present), evaluate:
      - `data-model.md`: consistency with spec and plan
      - `contracts/`: completeness of external surfaces implied by spec
      - `research.md`: decision quality and alternatives considered
      - `quickstart.md`: practicality and sufficiency of validation paths

4. **Generate a structured process review report**:
   1. Load `.specify/templates/review-template.md` (or `.specify/templates/review-template.md` if the installed template is not available) to understand the report structure and placeholders.
   2. Instantiate a concrete process review report by:
      - Replacing `[FEATURE_ID]`, `[FEATURE_NAME]`, `[REQUIREMENTS_KEY]`, and `[REVIEW_DATE]` (ISO) with values from the current feature context.
      - Filling **process-focused** observations: artifact quality, traceability, handoff quality, and workflow integrity.
      - Adding **improvement suggestions for speckit and SDD** (templates, prompts, checks, and workflow practices).
      - Respecting the heading and section structure defined in the template.
   3. Write the instantiated report to `REQUIREMENTS_DIR/review.md` (i.e. `.specify/specs/[REQUIREMENTS_KEY]/review.md`). If a report already exists, either overwrite it or merge intelligently according to project convention (by default, overwrite with the latest run).

5. **Report summary back to the user**:
    - Present a short summary including:
       - REQUIREMENTS_KEY and feature name (for artifact scoping only)
       - Paths of the reviewed artifacts (`requirements.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `review.md`, etc.)
       - A 3–5 bullet **process-level** recap of strengths, gaps, and recommended improvements to speckit/SDD
    - If any core artifacts were missing (e.g. `requirements.md` or `plan.md`), clearly state what was missing and how that affected the process review.

## Position in the Workflow

This command is intended to be used **after** `/speckit.implement` has completed for a feature. The typical end-to-end flow is:

Note: `/speckit.feature` manages the long-lived feature registry under `.specify/memory/` (ID/name/status). `/speckit.requirements` generates the detailed requirements specification under `.specify/specs/<REQUIREMENTS_KEY>/requirements.md`.

1. `/speckit.feature` – register or select a feature entry
2. `/speckit.requirements` – create or update the specification
3. `/speckit.plan` – produce the technical implementation plan
4. `/speckit.tasks` – derive an executable task list
5. `/speckit.implement` – implement tasks and complete the implementation
6. `/speckit.review` – review SDD artifact quality and provide improvement suggestions for the workflow itself

Use `/speckit.review` whenever you want to evaluate the **quality of the SDD process** and refine speckit/SDD practices based on the current artifact set.

## Handoffs

**Before running this command**:

- Run after `/speckit.implement` so there is a complete artifact chain to review.

**After running this command**:

- Apply improvements by iterating on `/speckit.requirements` and/or `/speckit.plan`.
- Optionally run `/speckit.analyze` to validate cross-artifact consistency after revisions.
