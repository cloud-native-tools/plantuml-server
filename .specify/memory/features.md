This file is a placeholder for the project's **feature registry**. It should be replaced with actual content during development.

- Use `/speckit.feature` to create/update the long-lived feature index and per-feature memory under `.specify/memory/`.
- Use `/speckit.requirements` to create/update the detailed requirements specification for a feature iteration under `.specify/specs/<REQUIREMENTS_KEY>/requirements.md`.
