# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
<!--
This is a PRESET template containing a set of generic project principles
and workflow guidelines. It is intended as a starting point only.

When adopting this constitution for a specific project, you MUST review,
add, remove, or modify principles and sections to match the actual
context, risk profile, and organizational policies of your project.
Do not assume this template is sufficient without customization.

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First Design
Every significant feature MUST begin as a cohesive, reusable library (module/package).
Libraries MUST:
- Be self-contained and independently testable.
- Have a single, clearly documented responsibility.
- Avoid being mere organizational/wrapper shells without real behavior.

Rationale: encourages reuse, clear boundaries, and easier testing.

### II. CLI & Text I/O Interface
Each library SHOULD expose a command-line interface (CLI) for core operations.
CLIs MUST:
- Accept input via stdin/arguments/files using plain text or JSON.
- Write normal results to stdout and errors to stderr.
- Prefer JSON for machine consumption and human-readable text for operators.

Rationale: standardizes integration, observability, and automation.

### III. Test-First Development
Implementation MUST follow a Test-Driven Development style for core logic:
- Write or update tests BEFORE implementing new behavior.
- Ensure tests FAIL first (Red), then implement to make them PASS (Green).
- Refactor only with all tests passing (Refactor).

At minimum:
- Pure functions/utilities MUST have unit tests.
- Critical flows MUST have automated regression coverage.

Rationale: reduces regressions and clarifies intent.

### IV. Integration & Contract Testing
Integration/contract tests SHOULD cover:
- Cross-service communication and external APIs.
- Shared schemas or data contracts.
- Critical end-to-end user journeys.

When real dependencies are hard to run locally, abstract them behind interfaces
and document follow-up contract tests in the plan/tasks.

Rationale: validates real-world behavior beyond unit tests.

### V. Observability, Versioning & Simplicity
All components MUST be observable and versioned:
- Use structured logs for important events and errors.
- Prefer semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Document any breaking changes and migration notes.
- Keep designs as simple as possible; avoid speculative features (YAGNI).

Rationale: makes systems debuggable, upgradable, and maintainable.

### VI. Continuous Integration & Quality Gates
Changes MUST be safe to merge:
- Linting, formatting, and basic tests MUST pass in CI.
- A minimal smoke test or example run SHOULD be provided for new features.
- New behavior MUST be reflected in specs/plan/tasks/docs where applicable.

Rationale: ensures consistent quality and predictable releases.

### VII. Feature-Centric Development
Feature 是项目的长期核心框架：
- Feature 列表必须保持为项目的“单一事实来源”。
- 在 spec → plan → tasks → implement 的每个阶段都必须复核 Feature 的新增/合并/拆分/删除。
- Feature 变更必须可追溯到相应的 spec/plan 依据，并记录在 Feature 详情中。

Rationale: 让项目演进以 Feature 为中心，确保长期一致性与可维护性。
