# [CHECKLIST TYPE] Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

**Purpose**: [Brief description of what this checklist covers]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Feature (Requirement Scope)**: [Link to feature entry or feature directory]
**Requirements (What)**: [Link to requirements.md]
**Specifications (How, context only)**: [Link to plan.md / tasks.md if relevant]

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command to validate the quality of **Requirements (What)** for the **Feature**. It may reference **Specifications (How)** only to surface gaps/ambiguities/conflicts and traceability issues in the requirements — not to test implementation behavior.

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The checklist items below are SAMPLE ITEMS for illustration only.
  
  The /speckit.checklist command MUST replace these with actual items based on:
  - User's specific checklist request
  - Feature scope (requirement-level) and Requirements (What) from requirements.md
  - Optional Specifications (How) context from plan.md / tasks.md ONLY to:
    - detect missing/implicit requirements
    - identify ambiguities/conflicts
    - ensure key design decisions are traceable back to requirements
  
  DO NOT keep these sample items in the generated checklist file.
